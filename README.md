## Introduction

Our mission at CodeHers is to help address the gender disparity within Computer Science. Currently, only around 20% of Computer Science majors are women, and we hope to inspire young girls to gain the courage to explore the subject. To do this, we are planning an event continuing off of last yearâ€™s success which consists of information booths, interactive tech demonstrations, guest speaker presentations, and student-run workshops. This GitHub repository serves to host the code for our website, which will be used to promote the event and provide information to those interested.
