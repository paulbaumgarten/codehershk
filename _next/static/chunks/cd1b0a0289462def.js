Using simple commands, variables, and loops, students will build their own text‑based adventure game—where every choice leads to a new twist in the story. The workshop focuses on core programming concepts in an approachable, beginner‑friendly format. By the end of the session, participants will understand how to store information using variables, repeat actions with loops, and control the flow of their program with conditional statements. Each concept is introduced through clear examples, collaborative activities, and plenty of opportunities to experiment and play. No advanced coding experience is required—just curiosity and imagination. By turning code into a storytelling tool, learners discover how programming can be both logical and creative.
