We will be hosting a speed building activity, where teams of 5-6 will be building the robots as fast as possible. After 10-15 minutes, we will check and see which team finished the quickest, or which team made the most progress. We have pre-built other robots for the tournament. The team who came first in the first activity will be first to choose which robot they want, the second team would be the second to choose, so on and so forth. We will be giving them around 10 minutes to either develop their robot or practice driving. They will choose 1 driver from the team for the tournament. As the tournament begins, all robots will start at the starting line of the track, the first robot to complete a lap would win the “girls power” trophy.",
